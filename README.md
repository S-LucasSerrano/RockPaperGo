**Rock Paper Go!** is Rock Papers Scissors but you can change your hand as much as you want before the time runs out. It is a small design exercise developed in a couple of days that explores the fun and tension of constantly trying to outsmart the person sitting next to you.

The game was quickly put together in a couple of days so the code may not be the best-written or structured one. But it sure was fan to develop and it sure is fun to play. Check it out! https://lucasserrano.itch.io/rockpapergo.
